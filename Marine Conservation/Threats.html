	<p>1.Overfishing </p>
		<div style="float: left; width: 55%; font-size:18;line-height: 1.5;">
<p>Overfishing is an important issue, with increasing demand for fish as a food source coupled with the advent of advanced fishing techniques. As the global population grows, so does the demand for seafood, resulting in an increased demand for fish. Unfortunately, the development of advanced fishing technology has enabled the fishery to catch fish efficiently. This overfishing disrupts the natural population dynamics of Marine species, leading to a decline in fish stocks and throwing the ecological balance of the ocean into disarray.</p></div>

	<p>2.Chemical PollutionÂ·</p>
	<p>Chemical pollution poses a major threat to the health of the oceans, as water bodies bear the brunt of the myriad chemicals that enter the Marine environment and accumulate over time. The effects of this pollution are profound, as the chemicals gradually take their toll on Marine flora and fauna, causing them to die, thus throwing the entire ecosystem out of balance, and also affected by the consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish.</p></div>

	<p>3.Plastic Waste</p>
	<p>The amount of plastic produced every year is staggering. Plastic is durable, does not degrade easily and can exist in the Marine environment for hundreds of years. This slow rate of decomposition, combined with the increasing use of plastic in everyday life, has led to a build-up of waste that threatens Marine life. Unfortunately, Marine animals often mistake plastic for food, ingest it and suffer a range of adverse effects. This can lead to internal injuries, starvation, and even death.</p></div>

		4.Burning of Fossil Fuels
<p> Burning fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, for energy and transport, at the same time they release large amounts of carbon dioxide. The ocean acts as a natural carbon sink, they will absorb a large proportion of carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it causes the pH to drop, making the water acidic. A drop in pH is harmful to Marine life, which can lead to weakened ecosystems, reduced biodiversity, and a negative impact on fishery.</p>
